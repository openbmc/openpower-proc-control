      "message": "When that \"openpower-update-bios-attr-table.service\" unit is called? Does it call in the added files path? What happens if the BIOS service did not call in that path since we added `After` so the original service will fail to start or is it will start?  I think `After` just make sure the order dependency so it will start - @Andrew, can you help me here?",

      "message": "The \"openpower-update-bios-attr-table.service\" starts when the BMC starts up, it\u0027s part of the openpower code update app. That\u0027s correct, \"After\" just makes sure the dependency is enforced, and since the bios attr service is set to start when the BMC boots up, then any services that have the \"After\" directive will wait for it to finish.",
