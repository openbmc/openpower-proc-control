      "message": "oh, I didn\u0027t realize we supported mpreboot on P9 systems? This commit wont hurt anything (since even if it does fail we have the || true to always return pass) but I\u0027ll need to look into my other change at line 18. I don\u0027t think that BIOS is defined in P9.\nFor your other question, \"change phosphor-debug-collector version bump to support the busctl command in 9\", I\u0027m not getting you on this one?",
