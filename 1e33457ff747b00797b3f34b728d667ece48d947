      "message": "I\u0027m a little confused on this one. clear_hostdumps_poweroff.service is run in the host-stop target. This service is run in the host-startmin target. Saying this service should run before clear_hostdumps_poweroff doesn\u0027t make sense? Also, if we do this, then the /run/openbmc/mpreboot@%i will always be deleted before clear_hostdumps_poweroff.service runs. I don\u0027t think this change is needed. Because they are in separate targets going in opposite directions, clear_hostdumps_poweroff.service will always run first in the MPIPL path which is I believe what you want.",
