/**
 * This is the backup plan to ensuring the host is not running before the
 * BMC issues a power off to the system. Prior to this procedure being called,
 * the BMC has tried all other communication mechanisms to talk with the host
 * and they have failed. The design is that the host firmware will write the
 * value 0xA5000001 to Mailbox scratch register 12 when they are up and running
 * to a point where communication to the BMC is no longer required to function.
 * On a power off or shutdown this register is cleared by the host and BMC
 * firmware. If the BMC sees the 0xA5000001 pattern in the scratch register
 * then it assumes the host is running and will leave power on to the system.
